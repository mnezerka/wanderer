The little prince, who asked
me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from
words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p><p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane;
that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:</p><p>The Little prince &ldquo;What is that object?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane.&rdquo;</p><p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p><p>He cried out, then:</p><p>&ldquo;What! You dropped down from the sky?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, modestly.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh! That is funny!&rdquo;</p><p>And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me
very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.</p><p>Then he added:</p><p>&ldquo;So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?&rdquo;</p><p>At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his
presence; and I demanded, abruptly:</p><p>&ldquo;Do you come from another planet?&rdquo;</p><p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my
plane:</p><p>&ldquo;It is true that on that you can&rsquo;t have come from very far away&mldr;&rdquo;</p><p>And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out
of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.</p><p>You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the
&ldquo;other planets.&rdquo; I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this
subject.</p><p>&ldquo;My little man, where do you come from? What is this &lsquo;where I live,&rsquo; of which
you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?&rdquo;</p><p>After a reflective silence he answered:</p><p>&ldquo;The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he
can use it as his house.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can
tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.&rdquo;</p><p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p><p>The Little prince and stars &ldquo;Tie him! What a queer idea!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But if you don&rsquo;t tie him,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he will wander off somewhere, and get
lost.&rdquo;</p><p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p><p>&ldquo;But where do you think he would go?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.&rdquo;</p><p>Then the little prince said, earnestly:</p><p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!&rdquo;</p><p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p><p>&ldquo;Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far&mldr;&rdquo;</p></div><div class=entry-gallery><style>.svelte-gallery{overflow:auto}</style><div id=gallery-el class=svelte-gallery></div><script type=text/javascript>let images=[];g=new Gallery({target:document.getElementById("gallery-el"),props:{images}})</script></div><div class=entry-meta><div class=tags-links><i class="icon fas fa-tag"></i>
