smallest alpine mountain range in Europe, renowned for its rugged peaks and
breathtaking landscapes. Armed with determination, climbing gear, and a deep
respect for the mountains, I embarked on a journey that would test my limits

&lt;p>My adventure began in the charming town of Poprad, Slovakia, which serves as
the gateway to the High Tatras. After a smooth flight and a short train ride, I
arrived in this picturesque town surrounded by towering peaks. I checked into a
cozy mountain lodge, unpacked my gear, and spent the afternoon exploring
Poprad. The blend of traditional Slovak architecture and modern amenities
provided a perfect setting to acclimatize.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Femundsmarka National Park</title><link>https://mnezerka.github.io/wanderer/posts/femundsmarka/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mnezerka.github.io/wanderer/posts/femundsmarka/</guid><description>&lt;p>Femundsmarka National Park, located in the heart of Norway, is a pristine
