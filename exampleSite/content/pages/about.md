The Little Prince (French: Le Petit Prince)  is a novella by French aristocrat,
writer, and military aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. It was first published in
English and French in the US by Reynal & Hitchcock in April 1943, and
posthumously in France following the liberation of France as Saint-Exupéry's
works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who
visits various planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of
loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book,
The Little Prince makes observations about life, adults and human nature.
