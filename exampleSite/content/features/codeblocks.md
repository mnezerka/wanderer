## Without type

```
This is plain code block
without setting any type
```

## Bash block 

```bash
echo "This is bash command"
```

And this one has long lines
```bash
echo "This is a very long bash command that cannot fit into content area of the generated website, so it needs a scrollbar"
```


## This is javascript

```javascript
let x = 0;
x += 1;
console.log(x);
```
