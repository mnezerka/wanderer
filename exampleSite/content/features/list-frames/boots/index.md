summary: Which boots for hiking?
---
My hiking boots are a key part of my travel gear—sturdy, comfortable, and built
to handle rough terrain. With solid ankle support, a grippy sole, and
waterproof materials, they keep my feet dry and secure whether I'm trekking
through forests, climbing rocky paths, or exploring muddy trails. They're
well-worn and reliable, always ready for the next adventure.
