It was first published in English and French in the US by Reynal &amp;amp; Hitchcock in April 1943, and posthumously in France following the liberation of France as Saint-Exupéry&amp;rsquo;s works had been banned by the Vichy Regime.
The story follows a young prince who visits various planets in space, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss.</description></item></channel></rss>
